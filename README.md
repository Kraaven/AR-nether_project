# Nether Portal project

I Finished the Plane Based AR tracking in the Mobile AR pathway on the Unity Learn platform. This project is both a final submission and a personal project


## Note

- The Application detects wall surfaces that the user can top on
- Wherever the user taps, A "Nether Portal", a dimention gateway mechanic from the game Minecraft is rendered. 
- Using Rendering tricks, it looks like the other dimention is being seen through the portal generated on the wall. 
- All the 3D models in the project were made by me in Blender 3D, and portal texturing using procedural shading in Blender.
